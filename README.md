## Development

Code dependencies are managed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). So you need to clone the repository and then fetch the dependencies via Composer.

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:<your-name-here>/podlove-publisher.git
cd podlove-publisher
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar --dev install
```

## Running the test suite

There is a test suite validating some Publisher functionality. It is based on Ruby/Mechanize. You need Ruby 2.0 or higher.

You need a local WordPress instance for tests. **The tests will override the database! DO NOT use the same database as for development or production!**.

*Preparations*

```
gem install mechanize
gem install rspec
cp test/config.example.yml test/config.yml 
```

*Run*

```
rspec test
```
