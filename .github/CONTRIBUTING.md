# Report a Bug

Something is not working?
Please follow the steps below to help us isolate the cause of error.

### Disable Podlove Cache

While testing, disable our internal cache. Put the following at the end of `wp-config.php`

```php
# wp-config.php
define('PODLOVE_TEMPLATE_CACHE', false);
```

### Disable other Caches

If you are using a caching plugin, please deactivate it. Examples for such plugins are:

- W3 Total Cache
- WP Super Cache
- Quick Cache

### Does it work when you use a default theme (like “twentyfifteen”)?

Sometimes themes change default WordPress behavior that breaks plugins. By testing your setup with a default theme, we can make sure it's not the themes fault.

### Does it work when you disable all plugins except the Publisher?

Just like the theme, other plugins might interfere with how the Publisher works.

### Now What?

You followed the steps above and the error still persists?
Create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/issues) if you haven't done so already, paste the output from your `Podlove ➜ Support` menu and mention that you have followed the steps above.

Thank you!

# Theme Incompatibility

Unfortunately, many themes are incompatible with [Custom Post Types](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types), which the Podlove Publisher uses for episodes. When you encounter problems, **please go to the theme support first**.

Only if you are sure you encountered a theme-related bug in the Podlove Publisher, post here. Otherwise, ask for help in our [community](https://community.podlove.org) or get [Professional Support](http://publisher.podlove.org/support/).
