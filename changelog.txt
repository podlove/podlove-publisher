Add support for Podlove Web Player 5

Podlove Web Player 5 is the latest overhaul of our podcast web player. 
It comes with its own configuration interface giving you full control over its appearance. 

Activate it in `Podlove > Podcast Settings > Player`. 
You are then prompted to install the "Podlove Web Player" plugin if you don't have it installed already.

Configure the web player appearance in `Settings > Podlove Web Player`. 
Existing web player shortcodes and template accessors continue to work as expected. 
For detailed shortcode options, please refer to https://wordpress.org/plugins/podlove-web-player/

**IAB Conformity**

When it comes to tracking download intents, Podlove Publisher was always close to IAB recommendations, with one exception: the time window in which two requests count as two. Podlove Publisher deduplicates by hour, IAB recommends a day.

There is a new setting in `Podlove > Expert Settings > Tracking`: "Deduplication Window". It enables you to change the window to "day". This is an opt-in setting, the default will continue to be hourly.

**Transcripts**

“Transcripts” is the new module to manage transcripts, show them on your site and in the web player. You can import them from webvtt files. If you are already using the Podlove Publisher contributors, you can assign people to the voices inside the webvtt. Then you even get avatars automatically in your transcripts.

See [https://forschergeist.de/podcast/fg066-klimaneutralitaet/](https://forschergeist.de/podcast/fg066-klimaneutralitaet/) for an example episode with transcripts in the web player.

**Transcripts: Shortcode**

The shortcode `[podlove-transcript]` displays a pretty html version of the transcript for your website. 

**Transcripts: Twig Template Support**

Of course there is a fully featured template API for transcripts as well. For example:

{% for group in episode.transcript %}
    <div class="ts-group">

        <div class="ts-speaker-avatar">
            {{ group.contributor.image.html({width: 50}) }}
        </div>

        <div class="ts-text">
            <div class="ts-speaker">
                {{ group.contributor.name }}
            </div>

            <div class="ts-content">
                {% for line in group.items %}
                <span class="ts-line">{{ line.content }}</span>
                {% endfor %}
            </div>
        </div>
        
    </div>
{% endfor %}

See [https://docs.podlove.org/podlove-publisher/reference/template-tags.html](https://docs.podlove.org/podlove-publisher/reference/template-tags.html "documentation") for all details.

**Global Podcast Analytics**

The following metrics are now available for the whole podcast:

- downloads per month
- top episodes
- episode asset
- podcast client
- operating system
- download source

**Raw Analytics**

I wouldn’t call this an Analytics API but since it exists to power the analytics screen, I might as well document it. The following endpoints return results in CSV format for easy processing or import to spreadsheets.

Here is an example call that returns the number of downloads in March 2019:

	https://your.domain/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=podlove-analytics-global-downloads-per-month&date_from=2019-03-01T00:00:00.000Z&date_to=2019-03-31T23:59:59.999Z

All requests take the same three parameters:

- `action` defines what data you want
- `date_from` is the start date in ISO 8601
- `date_end` is the end date in ISO 8601

Available actions are:

- podlove-analytics-global-downloads-per-month
- podlove-analytics-global-top-episodes
- podlove-analytics-global-assets
- podlove-analytics-global-clients
- podlove-analytics-global-systems
- podlove-analytics-global-sources

You need to be logged in with admin permissions for the requests to work.

Disclaimer: Depending on the popularity of your podcast and chosen date range, the requests may take a long time to respond, or even fail if the calculation takes longer than the timeout defined in your web server.

= 2.7.17 =

**Downloads Data Export**

Download data per episode can now be exported as JSON and CSV. 
On the Analytics page you will now find a simple export interface. 
Select the episodes you want in the export or don't select any to export them all at once.

**WP REST API Support**

Backbone for the data export is an implementation of the WP REST API.

Endpoint for the episode custom post type:

- /wp-json/wp/v2/episodes

Custom endpoints for episode analytics:

- /wp-json/podlove/v1/analytics/episodes/
- /wp-json/podlove/v1/analytics/episodes/123
- /wp-json/podlove/v1/analytics/episodes/123,82

All analytics are available as CSV by adding `?format=csv` as parameter, for example `/wp-json/podlove/v1/analytics/episodes/?format=csv`

Analytics endpoints require the `podlove_read_analytics` permission, the same as viewing analytics in the admin.

Please read https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/authentication/ if you want to use these endpoints.

= 2.7.7 =

Update 2.7.5 changed the way download tracking works to comply with GDPR. We tried the radical approach and anonymized IPs. As it turns out, this is not viable. Download numbers are skewed by this change and often much lower than they realistically should be. If you saw a drop in downloads since updating to 2.7.5 or 2.7.6, this is the reason.

The good news is that this update changes download tracking again and new download numbers should get back to normal. The bad news is that the data since the GDPR update cannot be fixed/restored because it's missing data granularity -- which was the point of the change; just not anitcipating the effect on the actual download numbers.

So what's the new tracking approach?

Podlove Publisher now stores the `request_id` again just like before the update: a hash based on the actual IP address and the user agent. What's new is that now once a day, all `request_id`s older than 24 hours are salted again, making it impossible to restore IPs from them. This 24 hour window is enough to determine download numbers exactly as before the GDPR update.

To be clear, IPs are never stored in plain text. But since IPs could be restored by brute force attack from the temporary unsalted `request_id` hashes, they have to be treated like plain IPs. The text snippet for your privacy page has been updated in the docs and you should update it on your site: https://docs.podlove.org/podlove-publisher/guides/dsgvo-gdpr.html

= 2.7.6 =

No changes.

= 2.7.5 =

**Preparation for GDPR/DSGVO**

If you are using Podlove Publisher Tracking/Analytics, an update to this version is highly recommended.

Tracking uses a `request_id` to be able to determine when two requests came from the same user and should be counted as one unique access. This request id used to be a hash of the original IP address and the user agent. This approach however is vulnerable to a brute force attack to get the IP address back from the hash. Here's what we are doing about that:

First, we anonymize the IP before generating the hash. So instead of using `171.23.11.209`, we use `171.23.11.0`.

Second, you need to deal with the existing `request_id`s. There is a new "DSGVO" section under "Tools" with a button that will rehash all existing `request_id`s with a randomly generated salt. That way it will become unfeasible to determine the original IP address but your analytics will stay the same.

In case you have a lot of downloads (let's say much more than 50.000), you may want to do this via command line because that will be _much_ quicker than via the tools section. You need [wp-cli](https://wp-cli.org/), then simply call `wp eval 'podlove_rehash_tracking_request_ids();'`. On a multisite, pass the blog id as a parameter: `wp eval 'podlove_rehash_tracking_request_ids(42);'`.

**New Module: Shows**

With shows you can offer feeds to subtopics of your podcast. Here's how it works: You create a show and define show meta, similar to a podcast: title, slug, subtitle, summary, image and language. These fields override your podcast settings. All other settings are the same as your podcast.

For each episode, you decide which show it's in. Each show has its own set of feeds that listeners can subscribe to. The main feed remains unchanged, containing all episodes from all shows.

The Podlove Subscribe Button can be configured to subscribe to a show by referencing the show slug. Use the shortcode `[podlove-subscribe-button show="show-slug"]` or the template tag `{ podcast.subscribeButton({show: 'show-slug'}) }}`.

We do not recommend using Shows and Seasons at the same time.

**Updated Metadata for Podcast/Episode/Seasons according to iOS11 Specification**

Apple announced an [updated specification for feed elements](http://podcasts.apple.com/resources/spec/ApplePodcastsSpecUpdatesiOS11.pdf). These changes enable the Apple Podcasts app to present podcasts in a better way. But since these feed extensions are readable by any podcast client, we expect others to take advantage of these new fields soon. Here is how we implemented the specification:

- The podcast has a new "type" field where you can select between "episodic" and "serial", which may affect the order of episodes. The field `<itunes:type>episodic</itunes:type>` appears in the feed.
- Episodes have a new "title" field. It defaults to the episode post title but can be set separately now, allowing you to define different titles for the website and podcast clients. The field `<itunes:title>Interview with Somebody Infamous</itunes:title>` will appear in the feed.
- Episodes have a new "type" field where you can select between "full" (default), "trailer" and "bonus". This won't have any effect in the Publisher but may be used by podcast clients. The field `<itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>` appears in the feed.
- Episodes have a new "number" field. If used, `<itunes:episode>42</itunes:episode>` will appear in the feed.
- Episodes in seasons will have an `<itunes:season>2</itunes:season>` field in the feed automatically.

We decided to complement these changes by introducing a podcast mnemonic/abbreviation field. Now we can autogenerate blog episode titles, based on the episode number and title, if you like. The mnemonic can be set in podcast settings. The setting to autogenerate blog episode titles is an expert setting in the "Website" section.

To help existing podcasts to conform to these new fields we made a "Title Migration" module which will greet you with a notice once you update the Publisher. It will try to extract episode numbers and titles from your existing titles, saving you time and effort updating each episode one by one.

**Template API Changes**

- `episode.title` now returns the new episode title field, if it is set, but has a fallback to the post title. If you want a specific version, use `episode.title.clean` or `episode.title.blog`.
- the post title of an episode can still be accessed via `episode.post.post_title`
- new accessor: `episode.number`
- new accessor: `episode.type`
- new accessor: `podcast.mnemonic`
- new accessor: `podcast.type`
- new accessor: `season.mnemonic`

**Podlove Web Player 4**

The Shortcode `[podlove-web-player]` accepts several parameters, increasing its versatility.

With `post_id` you can embed episodes on any page, for example `[podlove-web-player post_id="1234"]`.

Every [config parameter available](http://docs.podlove.org/podlove-web-player/config.html) can be overridden using shortcode attributes. The only difference from the linked documentation page is the notation. For nested configs like `show.title` use underscores (`_`) instead. For example, display a green player with custom title like this: `[podlove-web-player show_title="Special Title" theme_main="#00ff00"]`

You can now also display a player with _live content_ like this: `[podlove-web-player mode="live" audio_0_url="http://mp3.theradio.cc/" audio_0_mimeType="audio/mp3" title="Livestream" link="https://theradio.cc"]`

You can choose to deliver Podlove Player via Podlove CDN (Content Delivery Network) or via your WordPress server. CDN is the default for new setups but if you are already using Podlove Publisher we continue delivering Podlove Player via your WordPress server unless you explicitly change it.

Podlove Web Player 4 is the new default player.

**Podlove Web Player 4 Alpha**

After months of work we're ready to show you what we're working on: A new take on the modern Web Player. We learned from previous attempts and thought about responsiveness and embeddability from day one. Of course there's full support for chapter marks, too.

Give it a try if you like. Be aware though that it's marked as _alpha_, meaning we're still working on new features and fixing bugs in existing ones when we find them. But if you're curious, head over to `Podlove > Podcast Settings > Player`, switch to Podlove Web Player 4 and [let us know what you think](https://community.podlove.org/c/podlove-web-player).

Once Podlove Web Player 4 is stable, it will be the only actively supported Podlove Player. Podlove Web Player 3 isn't being developed anymore.

And finally, all web players can now be previewed on the settings screen.

**Templates**

* Assets now have an identifier `asset.id` to quickly access a file for an asset within an episode, for example: `episode.file("mp3")`
* Contributors already had such an id, but now there is a new accessor to get a single contributor by id, for example: `podcast.contributor("jerry")`
* DEPRECATED: id parameter in `podcast.contributors` to access a single contributor: `podcast.contributors({id: "jerry"})`.
* Feeds can now be accessed the same way by their slug: `podcast.feed("mp3")`

**Analytics**

Download tracking is now turned on by default in new setups.

* add support for Hindenburg project files

= 2.5.0 =

**New Chapter Management UI**

Until now if you wanted to add chapters to your podcast, you had to write the mp4chaps format by hand into a textfield. The Publisher now finally provides an easy-to-use interface to manage chapters that doesn't require any knowledge about the underlying formats.

The new inferace makes it simple to import chapters from files. We currently support [PSC (Podlove Simple Chapters)](https://podlove.org/simple-chapters/), mp4chaps and Audacity Track Labels. [Let us know](https://community.podlove.org/c/podlove-publisher) if we don't support your favorite program's export format.

**Module: Import/Export**

Podcast import has been rewritten to make full use of Background Jobs. That way podcasts of any size can be imported without running into system resource restrictions for large podcasts.

**Background Jobs**

The jobs dashboard on the tools page now shows job statuses in realtime (refreshes automatically).

Adjusted background job duration parameters and made them configurable. The change of defaults aims to make better use of available cron time (normally 30 seconds per request), which can speed up long running background jobs dramatically.

Please refer to the new [Background Jobs page in the documentation](http://docs.podlove.org/podlove-publisher/developer/background-jobs.html) for more details.

**Bits & Pieces**

* remove module: App.net (because they [are shutting down](http://blog.app.net/2017/01/12/app-net-is-shutting-down/))
* fix tracking export
* redirects (expert settings): redirect counter can be reset
* contributor avatars use WordPress media picker
* optimize use of JavaScript:
    - only load scripts on pages that require them
    - concatenate and minify some scripts

= 2.4.6 / 2.4.7 =

- Image cache: support non-pretty permalinks.
- fix feed compatibility issue with [Relevanssi plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/relevanssi/)
- services: fix lastfm url scheme (thanks [jazzcrack](https://github.com/jazzcrack))

= 2.4.5 =

Image cache: change URL encoding method to fix Gravatar issues.

= 2.4.4 =

Further image cache improvements:

- reject URLs that are not images
- prefix query vars to avoid naming conflicts with other plugins
- fix resizing sometimes not calculating the correct dimensions
- enhancement: skip http when using images shipped with the Publisher; copy images from Publisher to cache directory on filesystem instead

= 2.4.3 =

Fix issue with broken images introduced in 2.4.2.

= 2.4.2 =

**Improve Image Caches**

Images relevant to the Podlove Publisher are downloaded so they can be resized to desired dimensions. This makes it possible to deliver retina-images and improves the website performance because only the appropriate image size delivered.

This requires files to be downloaded. Until now, this happened in the background to avoid slow web page load times when the image is fetched. Until the cache existed, the original file URL to the unresized file was used. This worked alright, unless you were using a page cache plugin. The original file URL would be used much longer than necessary, causing big file downloads.

Now a different approach is used. Instead of the original file URL, a dynamic link is generated, looking like this one: `https://example.com/podlove/image/http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fmedia%2Fmypodcast%2Fmy-podcast-logo-1500x1500.jpg/300/300/0/my-podcast`. When this link is requested, the cached and resized image is either delivered or, if it doesn't exist, generated on-the-fly. Once the cached file exists, the direct link to the cached file is delivered, just like before. The major improvement is that even if the initial URL is stuck in your page cache, the Publisher is now able to deliver a properly resized image anyway.

* fix Auphonic: when neither episode image nor post thumbnail are present, fallback to podcast cover art
* fix PHP warnings in oembed module
 
= 2.4.0 =

**Background Jobs System**

Crunching numbers for Analytics takes time, especially for popular podcasts with many downloads. The old system was written optimistically and "let's-hope-we-finish-before-we-run-out-of-time"-ish. That was certainly good enough for podcasts with a few hundred downloads per episode, but more likely a gamble for popular shows.
To solve this issue in a scaleable way, we built what is known as "background processing" or "queues". That way we can break big tasks into small chunks and process them step by step. You don't really need to know about this, since the main effect is that calculating analytics should be a smoother experience (if you have ever had troubles in that regard) but if you are curious, have a look at the new "Tools" section, which lists running and recently finished jobs.

**New Analytics Dashboard**

* "Downloads per Day" is a stacked bar chart now so you can see which episode is responsible for peaks
* Downloads table now shows downloads in time segments starting from the moment of episode release for better comparability
* Show total number of all downloads in Analytics Dashboard
* New information under downloads table: age of the data and when the next refresh is due
* _MUCH_ better performance / page load times
* New option to configure how many episodes per page should be shown

**Podlove Web Player 2 Facelift**

* simplified, modernised look
* responsive layout for mobile devices
* fix: updated mediaelement library to fix volume bar display bug

**Podigee Podcast Player**

The [Podigee Podcast Player](https://www.podigee.com/en/podcast-player) is available as an alternative to the Podlove Web Players. It supports everything you can expect from a modern web player like chaptermarks. It is also embeddable.

**New "Tools" Menu**

= 2.3.12 =

Design Update for Podlove Subscribe Button

* The button now follows a flat design and has more options for customizability.
* See [docs.podlove.org/podlove-subscribe-button](http://docs.podlove.org/podlove-subscribe-button/) for a range of possible display variants.
* Widget module has been updates to support a color picker and settings for size, format and style. When using the "WordPress Customizer" you get a live preview of the button.
* If you are using the Template API, have a look at the updated [`podcast.subscribeButton` parameters](http://docs.podlove.org/podlove-publisher/reference/template-tags.html#podcast).

= 2.3.6 =

**Bugfixes**

* When creating a new contributor, social and donation services are saved correctly
* Deleting a contributor shows the correct confirmation message

**Enhancements**

* Podlove Subscribe Button: When an iTunes id is known for a feed, the button does not just pass the feed URL to the client when iTunes or Podcasts App are chosen. It redirects the user to the iTunes directory first. Because if you don't do this, "[it] does not increase your visibility on the iTunes Store or allow you to earn commission as part of the Affiliate Program." (http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html)
* Detect and warn if an episode slug has been used before

Updating all the things for your pleasure.

= 2.3.2 =

* fix: deleting image cache when no image cache directory exists
* fix: cache purge also deletes timeout entries
* fix: cache purge affects downloads table
* fix: JavaScript event for secondary download button
* fix: default template assignment on plugin activation
* fix: unpublished relates episodes do not appear when using the shortcode or template accessor

= 2.3.1 =

* simplify download buttons (`[podlove-episode-downloads style="buttons"]`) style to better adapt to themes
* fix: missing "Show URL" download button in twentyfifteen theme
* fix: URL structure for YouTube channels
* fix: player visibility when JavaScript is disabled
* fix: stop loading nonexisting player assets in WordPress admin area
* enhanced system report: change wording for `open_basedir` issue to clarify that it _should_ be fixed but a workaround exists
* enhanced plugin loading
  * When upgrading from version 1.x to 2.x using PHP 5.3, the upgrade lead to the "White Screen of Death" because 2.x requires PHP 5.4. This case is now handled and the Publisher shows an appropriate admin notice.
  * Some shared hosters seem to have problems with the plugin update process, which leads to the Publisher missing files and breaking the site. This is now also detected and a notice appears, asking the user to manually redownload the plugin.

= 2.3.0 =

**New Module: Seasons**

Do you have seasonal content? We got you covered. The new "Seasons" module allows you to group episodes into seasons. Each season has a title and other optional metadata, like a custom image. You can access all this data using the template system.

New Template accessors:

- `episode.season` returns the season for the episode
- `podcast.seasons` returns a list of all seasons
- `season.episodes` returns a list of all episodes in a season

**New Module: Flattr**

Everything Flattr related was moved into its own module.
If you don't use Flattr, you can turn it off and it gets out of your way.

* If you are using the Flattr module, we write Flattr payment information into podcast feeds. This way you don't need to rely on the official Flattr plugin to do this. You can probably deactivate it if you were using it since we provide the main functionality within the Publisher now.
* We recently changed the default `flattr` parameter in shortcodes. Now there's a setting in Flattr Podcast Settings where you can define the default parameter for contributor shortcodes.

**New Module: Related Episodes**

You can now express that episodes are related to each other. You can list all related episodes using the new shortcode `[podlove-related-episodes]` or using the template accessor `episode.relatedEpisodes`.

**Templates & Themes**

If you are developing themes, you now have full access to the Publisher Template system. The API is exactly the same as in Twig, just the syntax is different. At the moment, there are 4 entry points:

- `\Podlove\get_episode()`
- `\Podlove\get_podcast()`
- `\Podlove\get_flattr()`
- `\Podlove\get_network()`

Please see the ["Understanding Templates" guide](http://docs.podlove.org/guides/understanding-templates/) for more details.

**Other**

* Use WordPress Object Cache API to cache model objects. All entities fetched by id are cached and reused within the same page call. Performance gains are most notably in complex templates, which often access the same data repeatedly.
* Analytics: Update & improve user agent detection library so you can have more accurate analytics.
* Canonical feed URLs. WordPress respects if you want your URLs to end with a slash or not (you do that by adding or removing the trailing slash from your WordPress permalink settings custom structure). Our feed URLs now respect this choice, too. Furthermore, we permanently redirect to the canonical URL if another one was accessed to ensure all clients access _exactly_ the same feed URL.
* News from podlove.org are displayed in the Podlove Dashboard
* Users with role "author" and higher now have access to the Podlove Dashboard and Analytics. They only have access to dashboard sections that make sense for authors, so they won't see logging, feed or asset validation.
* Contributors can now be edited in _Contributor Settings_ (instead of _Episodes > Contributors_)
* Contributors Social Services: It is now possible to add a YouTube "Channel", not just user profiles
* Contributors Social Donations: Add "paypal.me" option
* Add functionality to automatically determine the duration for episodes. This is especially useful for people who don't use Auphonic, which already determines the duration automatically.
* We are now able to handle media files that are served without a "Content-Length" header. A specific warning is generated and the size is displayed as "unknown", but the files are treated as valid so they can be played.
* Add support for Auphonic webhooks. This allows us to import your episode metadata once an Auphonic production is finished — even if you navigated away from the episode page.
* Podcast cover image can now be uploaded using the WordPress media uploader.
* Add `contributor.gender` template accessor
* Rename network list "description" to "summary" for consistency. In templates `list.description` is now deprecated. Please use `list.summary` instead.
* fix: Shortcodes in episode subtitle and summary are not interpreted any more. Both fields were always considered plain text and having shortcodes leads to various issues, especially in feeds.
* export files are now gzipped if possible
* fix JavaScript incompatibility related to Diaspora plugin ([#771](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/pull/771), [#770](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/pull/770), [#425](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/issues/425), thanks [@noplanman](https://github.com/noplanman)!)
* fix: failing geo-lookup does not break tracking links
* fix: Remove WordPress favicon (since WP 4.3) from podcast feeds if a podcast image is set
* fix: pasting into a template creates change-marker
* fix: tracking import does not skip the last few entries

= 2.2.4 =

* fix: erratically missing chapter information in RSS feeds
* fix: "Allow to skip feed redirects" setting was sometimes ignored

= 2.2.3 =

* fix: web player image fallback to podcast image when an episode image asset is defined but unused
* fix: gzip compression: only set content type if headers have not been sent
* fix: in networks, don't schedule template cleanups for blogs without an active Publisher

= 2.2.2 =

* fix: template cache issue where duplicate purge cronjobs could flood the cron system
* fix: image cache validation (didn't work due to missing library)

= 2.2.1 =

* fix: App.net announcement preview in modules
* fix: asset validations are always scheduled properly
* fix: Remove method calls that require WordPress 4.0+ (wpdb::esc_like)

= 2.2.0 =

**Image Caching, Resizing & Retina Support**

We now take better control of podcast images, episode images, contributor avatars and our own social icons. 
We are able to *resize* them to ideal sizes, which results in *faster page load times* for your users. *Retina 
images* for higher-resolution displays are also supported. We do this automatically, so all you need to do 
is click update, lean back and enjoy.

Read all the details in our blog post ["Podlove Publisher 2.2: Say hello to image caching"](http://podlove.org/2015/05/20/podlove-publisher-2-2/)

This update increases the WordPress requirement from 3.0 to 3.5 (due to the required image editing functionality).

**Other**

* fix: duplicate feed discovery
* fix: ignore incomplete feed configurations
* fix: don't include network admin module css in frontend
* fix: dashboard episode edit links
* fix: when deleting WordPress Network sites, trigger plugin uninstall to remove database tables
* fix: web player flash fallback
* fix: network templates now also appear in the template widget and template auto-insert setting
* fix: issue where some database tables were not created
* fix: podcast covers are displayed in frontend admin menu bar
* show Twig template errors in dashboard log
* web player template tag can set tracking context: `episode.player({context: 'landing-page'})`
* add `episode.categories` template tag

**Deprecations**

- deprecated `episode.imageUrl`, use `episode.image` instead
- deprecated `episode.imageUrlWithFallback`, use `episode.image({fallback: true})` instead
- deprecated `podcast.imageUrl`, use `podcast.image` instead
- deprecated `service.logoUrl`, use `service.image` instead
- deprecated `contributor.avatar`, use `contributor.image` instead

While you are changing these, consider scaling them down appropriately. Your images are probably huge but in many cases you don't need the full size. So instead of `episode.image` or `episode.image.url`, specify a size, like this `episode.image.url({width: 200})`.

= 2.1.3 =

= 2.1.1 =

* fix: remove obsolete "Add New" template button from network templates screen
* fix: template autoinsert does not use deprecated "id" parameter
* fix: template widget does not use deprecated "id" parameter
* fix: duplicate episodes in feeds
* fix: some server configurations (especially on shared webhosting) break cURLs ability to follow HTTP redirects. We now check for that configuration and, if necessary, resolve the URL manually before continuing normally.
* fix: XSS vulnerabilities in contributors search
* fix: Template accessor `contributor.id` now correctly returns the id, not the uri. `contributor.uri` is the new accessor to get the uri.
* fix: Filtering contributions by id is now correctly affected by other filters, like group and role. Until now, `podcast.contributors({id: 'james', role: 'on-air'})` always returned James, no matter if he had the given role or not. 
* add "Add New Contributor" item to contributor select list. Selecting it opens the screen to add a new contributor.
* add Twig version to system report

= 2.1.0 =

**Networks: WordPress Multisite Support is Here**

* fix: remove Jetpack "Site Icon" from podcast feeds
* fix: empty template editor when last template is deleted
* fix: empty caches when a scheduled episode gets published
* fix analytics episode average calculation for ancient episodes

**API changes**

* Flattr parameter in `[podlove-episode-contributor-list]` now defaults to "no". If you need to reactivate it, use `[podlove-episode-contributor-list flattr="yes"]`
* `[podlove-web-player]` was renamed to `[podlove-episode-web-player]` to avoid clashes with the standalone web player plugin. For now, the old shortcode still works.
* `[podlove-subscribe-button]` was renamed to `[podlove-podcast-subscribe-button]` to avoid clashes with the standalone button plugin. For now, the old shortcode still works.

= 2.0.3 =

*Allow Non-Admins to access Analytics*

Analytics have a new capability called "podlove_read_analytics".
You can provide access to, for example, editors, using the following code snippet:

    function podsnip_add_capability() {
        // default roles: editor, author, contributor, subscriber
        $role = get_role('editor');
        $role->add_cap('podlove_read_analytics');
    }
    add_action( 'admin_init', 'podsnip_add_capability');

You can add snippets using the "Code Snippets" plugin.

**Download Analytics**

You want to know more about who listens to your podcast? We got you covered.

We spent months of research and prototyping to find a reliable way of tracking. We are confident that our approach works and produces trustworthy data. If you have not done so yet, you have to activate tracking in _Expert Settings -> Tracking_.

If you are interested in all the technical details, head over to http://docs.podlove.org/guides/download-analytics/.

But what you are seeing now is just the beginning. We have a plethora of ideas on how to give you even more insight into the data available. Stay tuned!

We are curious what you think about the current analytics interface? What do you love? What do you hate? What do you miss? Head over to our new community site and share your thoughts: https://community.podlove.org/

    {% for service in contributor.services({type: "email"}) %}
        <a target="_blank" href="{{ service.profileUrl }}">{{ service.rawValue }}</a>
    {% endfor %}

= 1.10.22 =

* fix caching issue (cache keys were too long in last update, resulting in no cache hits at all)
* fix error when creating a new episode

= 1.10.18 =

**Improvements to media file slugs**

* Slugs may contain slashes now. This allows storing asset files in subfolders and using the WordPress media uploader to manage files.
* Media file validation is more consistent: when you get a green checkmark, the file is guaranteed to be valid and reachable.

**Other**

* Once we release Publisher 2.0, we will increase the minimum PHP version to 5.4 and recommend 5.5. A notice is now displayed in the system report if you are running a version requiring an upgrade.

* remove "Critical Podlove Warnings" — they are scary and don't help a lot

= 1.10.16 =

* Hotfix: remove wrong output in HTML sites
* rework support page

= 1.10.15 =

**Various Fixes and Enhancements**

* Supply web player API with more data: "publicationDate" contains an ISO-8601 date and "show.url" the URL to the show.
* Auphonic UI improvement: When selecting a production, the "Select existing production" option disappears.
* Don't pass `redirect=no` parameter to feed URLs
* Ensure web player IDs are unique to avoid rendering bugs
* Fix caching bug that lead to disappearing web player and download buttons
* Fix redirection UI bug
* Flush rewrite rules after migrations to avoid broken links

= 1.10.14 =

**Performance**

A simple yet effective caching strategy has been implemented. This is used to cache rendered site segments. A complete cache invalidation happens when podcast related data changes. This should be a good start since such data rarely changes (mostly when a new episode is published). In a Multisite setup, each site handles its cache separately.

This is implemented using the [Transients API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API). By default, WordPress uses the database as a caching backend. If you want to squeeze out even more speed, consider installing a [Persistent Cache Plugin](http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Object_Cache#Persistent_Cache_Plugins) which replaces the database with a more efficient caching backend, such as memcached or APC. That might require some fiddling around, though.

Caching can be deactivated in the `wp-config.php` with the following line: `define('PODLOVE_TEMPLATE_CACHE', false);`

* Cache Publisher templates
* Cache feed discovery header
* Cache Bitlove widget
* Other minor performance improvements

**Templates**

* There is now a default template containing the player and download section
* Episode contributions can be sorted by comment and position, for example: `episode.contributors({orderby: "comment", order: "DESC"})` or episode.contributors({orderby: "position", order: "ASC"})
* Iterate over the list of episode tags: `{% for tag in episode.tags({order: "DESC", orderby: "count"}) %} {{ tag.name }} {% endfor %}`

**Other**

* Display available processing time in Auphonic production box
* Episode slugs may contain a wider variety of characters now, such as umlauts.
* Feeds now only contain contributors with an URI. Also, output of contributors in feeds can be filtered by group and/or role.
* New donation option for Auphonic Credits
* Remove scary debug output on failed media file validations. This can be found in the log now.
* Fix Auphonic authentication issue by providing the whole certificate chain
* Fix contributor related feed rendering issue

= 1.10.13 =

We decided to remove the "Force Download" feature. Its purpose was to guarantee that a click on a download button results in a download dialogue, rather than playing the media file in the browser. The way we implemented it worked, but came with many downsides. Just to name two of them:
1) We doubled the traffic and significantly increased load since we had to pull all the bytes through the webserver in addition to the download server (even if both are the same).
2) It was impossible to support HTTP range requests. That means no client was able to resume a broken or paused download. It also seemed to lead to strange behaviour in the web player.

But there is another, superior way to force downloads: configure your download server. The important setting here is [Content-Disposition](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec19.html#sec19.5.1).

In *Apache*, you need the `headers` module (`a2enmod headers` on Debian-ish distributions). Then you can add this to your configuration:

    <FilesMatch "\.(mp3|m4a|ogg|oga|ogv|opus|mpg|m4v|webm|flac|pdf|epub|zip)$">
        Header set Content-Disposition attachment
    </FilesMatch>

*lighttpd*:

    $HTTP["url"] =~ "\.(mp3|m4a|ogg|oga|ogv|opus|mpg|m4v|webm|flac|pdf|epub|zip)$" {
        setenv.add-response-header = ("Content-Disposition" => "attachment")
    }

*Nginx*:

    if ($request_filename ~ "\.(mp3|m4a|ogg|oga|ogv|opus|mpg|m4v|webm|flac|pdf|epub)$"){
        add_header Content-Disposition 'attachment';
    }

**Other Changes**

* Trim whitespace around some URLs that appear in the podcast feed.
* Update certificate for auth.podlove.org
* Fix an issue with saving contributors in `Podlove > Podcast Settings > Contributors`

= 1.10.12 =

**Tracking**

* Never redirect media file URLs to trailing-slash-URLs (WordPress has a habit of adding a trailing slash to every URL via redirect. That is undesirable here, since it create two download intents).
* Handle empty user agent strings
* Do not write anything to tracking-database unless tracking is in analytics mode.

**Other**

* Compress export files via gzip.
* Add tracking data to export files.

= 1.10.11 =

**Tracking**

* For increased compatibility (we are looking at you, iTunes), new file URLs without parameters are used when analytics are active.
* Add `&ptm_file=<episode-slug>.<file-extension>` parameter to the end of Parameter-URLs, so tools like wget generate a filename with a correct extension by default.
* Feed URLs now support a `&tracking=no` parameter, which dynamically disables tracking parameters in feed enclosures. This is introduced for debugging purposes and is only mentioned here for the sake of completeness.
* Fix PHP glitch that caused tracking to go into "Tracking URL Parameters" mode even when it was disabled

**ADN Module**

* Fix issue that could lead to repostings
* Fix tags description
* Messages longer than 256 characters will be shortened now and "…" will be appended

**Other**

* Fix: reenable "force download" option

= 1.10.10 =

We discovered incompatibilities between our tracking implementation and some clients. To avoid further trouble, we are *deactivating tracking* until we solve the issue. The option is still available, we just switch it off automatically with this release and it isn't on by default any more.

If you're of the curious type, feel free to activate it and tell us any issues you run into. Thanks!

= 1.10.9 =

* Fix: When tracking was active but no geo-location database available, downloads would fail. This exception is handled correctly now. You can check the status of tracking and the geo-location database in `Expert Settings > Tracking`

= 1.10.8 =

* Feature: Services in templates can be filtered by their type. That way, you can, for example, iterate over all Twitter accounts via `podcast.services({type: "twitter"})`. The previous "type" parameter (for choosing between "social", "donation" and "all") has been renamed to "category". All default templates have been adjusted accordingly _but if you were using this API in a custom template, you need to change it_.
* Feature: `podcast.contributors` in templates are sorted by name now. You can change the order by writing `podcast.contributors({order: "DESC"})`. When using grouping, each group will be sorted separately.
* Feature: `podcast.contributors({scope: "global-active"})` is limited to contributors with at least one contribution in a published episode. To list contributors ignoring this limitation, use `podcast.contributors({scope: "global"})`. "global-active" is the new default.
* Feature: Allow manual posting of ADN announcements
* Feature: Add contributor support to ADN announcements
* Feature: We are beginning to implement download intent tracking and statistics. As a first step, we are now tracking download intents. A following release will contain an analytics section where you can examine the statistics.

* Enhancement: remove encryption for "protected feed" password to prevent autofill browser features to destroy contents
* Enhancement: default WordPress search now covers episode subtitle, summary and chapters
* Enhancement: add Vimeo, Gittip and about.me to services
* Enhancement: The expert setting "Display episodes on front page together with blog posts" changed to "Include episode posts on the front page and in the blog feed". So if you set it, episodes will additionally appear in `/feed`. However, only in the form of a post. You will not find enclosures, iTunes metadata etc. in `/feed` items.
* Enhancement: sort chapters imported from Auphonic by time
* Enhancement: Changes to feed list: redirect URL is shown and added screen options to hide columns
* Enhancement: Added Publisher version as an attribute to the export file. If a file is imported with a version different from the current Publisher, a warning is displayed.
* Fix: enable group and role selection in contributor shortcodes
* Fix: failing delayed ADN broadcast
* Fix: stop sending ADN announcements for old episodes
* Fix: refresh of Auphonic presets keeps current preset

* Fix: "Network Activate" works now
* Fix: group and role filters for `[podlove-podcast-contributor-list]` shortcode work as expected now
* Fix: Add services and donations to export format

* Fix: Instagram URL scheme

= 1.10.6 =

* Fix: contributor services will be saved correctly
* Enhancement: add a donation column to contributor management table

= 1.10.5 =

**Changes to the Templating System**

`episode.recordingDate` and `episode.publicationDate` are DateTime objects now. Available accessors are: year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds. For custom formatting, use `episode.recordingDate.format("Y-m-d H:i:s")` for example. Calling `episode.recordingDate` directly is still supported and defaults to the format configured in WordPress.

**Other Changes**

* Enhancement: Add refresh buttons for ADN patter and broadcast channel selectors
* Fix: Avoid "Grey Goo" scenario of self-replicating contributors

= 1.10.4 =

* Hotfix: solve migration issue

**Changes to the Templating System**

* New filter: `padLeft(padCharacter, padLength)` can be used to append a character to the left of the given string until a certain length is reached. Example: `{{ "4"|padLeft("0",2) }}` returns "04";
* For consistency `{{ contributor.avatar }}` is now an object. To render an HTML image tag, use `{% include '@contributors/avatar.twig' with {'avatar': contributor.avatar} only %}`.
* `{{ episode.duration }}` has been turned into an object to enable custom time renderings. The duration object has the following accessors: hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds and totalMilliseconds.

__DEPRECATIONS/WARNINGS__

* `{{ episode.duration }}` should not be used any more. The default templates are updated but if you have used it in a custom template, you must replace it. Example: `{{ episode.duration.hours }}:{{ episode.duration.minutes|padLeft("0",2) }}:{{ episode.duration.seconds|padLeft("0",2) }}`
* `{{ episode.license.html }}` and `{{ podcast.license.html }}` are deprecated. Use `{% include '@core/license.twig' %}` for the previous behaviour of choosing the correct license based on context. If you want to be more specific, use `{% include '@core/license.twig' with {'license': episode.license} %}` or `{% include '@core/license.twig' with {'license': podcast.license} %}`.

**Other Changes**

* Feature: ADN Module supports broadcasts

* Feature: New accessor `{{ file.id }}`. This is required to generate download forms.
* Fix: `[podlove-episode-contributor-list]` shortcode: Firstly, the "title" attribute works again. Secondly, output by group is optional now and defaults to "not grouped" (as it was before 1.10). If you are using contributor groups and would like grouped output, use `[podlove-episode-contributor-list groupby="group"]`
* Fix: division by zero bug in statistics dashboard
* Fix: parse time in statistics dashboard correctly as normalplaytime
* Fix: add missing template accessor `{{ episode.recordingDate }}`
* Remove separate "publication date" field in episodes. Instead, use the episode post publication date maintained by WordPress. It can be accessed via `{{ episode.publicationDate }}`

**All-new, mighty Templating system**

You can now use the [Twig Template Syntax](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/documentation) in all templates. Access all podcast/episode data via the new template API. Please read the [Template Guide](http://docs.podlove.org/tut/understanding-templates.html) to get started.

If you have used templates before, please note that some shortcodes are now _DEPRECATED_. That means they still work but will be removed at some point. Following is a list of affected shortcodes and their replacements:

Instead of `[podlove-web-player]`, write `{{ episode.player }}`.

Instead of `[podlove-podcast-license]`, write `{{ podcast.license.html }}`.

Instead of `[podlove-episode-license]`, write `{{ episode.license.html }}`.

Instead of `[podlove-episode field="subtitle"]`, write `{{ episode.subtitle }}`. Instead of `[podlove-episode field="summary"]`, write `{{ episode.summary }}` etc. When in doubt, look at the [Episode Template Reference](http://docs.podlove.org/ref/template-tags.html#episode).

Changing the podcast data shortcodes works exactly the same: Instead of `[podlove-podcast field="title"]`, write `{{ podcast.title }}` etc. When in doubt, look at the [Podcast Template Reference](http://docs.podlove.org/ref/template-tags.html#podcast).

**Other Changes**

* Feature: The Podlove dashboard includes a section for feeds if you activate the "Feed Validation" module. It is intended as an overview for the state of your feeds. It shows the latest modification date, the number of entries, compressed and uncompressed size and the latest item. Additionally, you can validate your feeds against the w3c feed validator right from the dashboard.
* Feature" Better Bitlove integration. There is a new setting in `Podlove > Podcast Feeds > Directory Settings` called "Available via Bitlove?". It checks if there is a corresponding Bitlove feed and verifies it on a regular basis.
* Feature: Support for the oEmbed format
* New shortcode: `[podlove-episode-list]` lists all episodes including their episode image, publication date, title, subtitle and duration chronologically. This replaces the archive pages generated by the [Archivist - Custom Archive Templates](https://wordpress.org/plugins/archivist-custom-archive-templates/) plugin, if you are using it right now.
* New shortcode: `[podlove-feed-list]` lists all public feeds
* New shortcode: `[podlove-global-contributor-list]` shows all podcast contributors and lists related episodes.
* New shortcode: `[podlove-podcast-contributor-list]` shows regular podcast contributors
* Enhancement: The feed title may now include the asset title for easier discovery. This setting can be found at `Podlove > Feed Settings`
* Changed shortcode: `[podlove-contributor-list]` is _DEPRECATED_. Please use `[podlove-episode-contributor-list]` instead.
* Enhancement: add "autogrow" feature to chaptermarks text field
* Enhancement: globally hide the migration-tool banner once dismissed rather than per-client via cookie
* Fix: When setting the chapter asset to manual, delete all chapter caches to avoid hiccups
* Fix: Contributor links in the backend use an ID now rather than the contributor slug. That way they work when no slug is set.
* Fix ADN backslash escaping issue in post titles
* Fix: all contributions can be deleted

= 1.9.12 =
* Enhancement: Take over chapters when switching from chapter asset to manual

**New Module: Contributors**

Podcasts are not possible without their active communities. Huge contributions are being made behind the scenes and nobody notices except the podcaster. The contributors module shines light on all those diligent people. It's now easy to manage contributors of an episode and list them on the blog. The list contains references to their social profiles and the donation service Flattr. Shortcode to display them in an episode post: [`[podlove-contributor-list]`](http://docs.podlove.org/ref/template-tags.html#contributors).

**Simple Protected Feeds**

You can now protect some or all of your feeds using HTTP authentication. Authenticate via a defined username and password or use the WordPress user database as backend.

**License Selector**

We built an interface to generate a Creative Commons license for your podcast and episodes. You can still use a custom URL and name if you don't want a CC license. Use `[podlove-podcast-license]` and `[podlove-episode-license]` to display them in your episode posts.

**Other Changes**

* Feature: Add "Expert Settings" option to always redirect to media files instead of forcing a browser download. This is interesting for you if you want to minimize traffic on your server hosting the Publisher.

In the beginning, everything evolved around the episode numbers and the

episode assistant.

Now, the mnemonic is merely an afterthought. It's used by no part of
the system except the episode assistant. And this doesn't do a lot that
can't be done without it either. So we decided to drop both for now.

A similar concept might return once we tackle stuff like seasons.
