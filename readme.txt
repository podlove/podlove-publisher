The one and only next generation podcast publishing system. Seriously. It's magical and sparkles a lot.

== Description ==

We built the Podlove Podcast Publisher because existing solutions are stuck in the past, complex and unwieldy. The Publisher helps you save time, worry less and provides a cutting edge listening experience for your audience.

Official Site: [publisher.podlove.org](http://publisher.podlove.org/)

= Video Tutorial: Getting started with Podlove Publisher =

= Compatible Feeds =

The Publisher makes it easy to create highly expressive, efficient and super compatible podcast feeds with fine grained control over client behavior (e.g. GUID control to replace faulty episodes and for clients to reload) supporting all important meta data.

= Multi-Format Publishing =

The Publisher also makes multi-format publishing - embracing all modern and legacy audio and video codecs - a snap. By adopting simple file name conventions, the plugin allows the podcaster to provide individual feeds for certain use cases or audiences without adding work for the podcaster during the publishing process.

= Optimized Web Player =

The Publisher also comes with integrated with the Podlove Web Player plugin (which you do not need to install separately) and fully support its advanced options including multiple audio (MP4 AAC, MP3, Vorbis, Opus) and video (MP4 H.264, WebM, Theora) format support for web browsers. This Web Player is fully HTML5 compatible (but provides Flash fallback for ancient environments) and is ready for all touch based clients too.

= Chapter Support =

The Publisher also makes it easy to publish chapter information in the player to make access to structured episodes even easier. Full support for linking directly to any part of your podcast on the web with instant playback included.

= Flexible Templates =

To round it all up, a flexible template system enables you to published Podcasts in a defined fashion and change the style at any time without having to touch your individual postings later on.

And this is just the beginning. We have a rich roadmap that will bring even more interesting features: integration with helpful services, much improved timeline metadata support (show notes) and much more.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Yes! The core features of Podlove Podcast Publisher are and always will be free. [Paid Professional Support](https://publisher.podlove.org/support/) is available but not necessary to run the plugin.

### Are there Download Statistics?

Yes! Podcast Downloads can be tracked and analyzed. You can easily see how many people downloaded you podcast episodes, which clients they used, if they prefer to subscribe to the feed or listen on your website using the web playerâ€”and much more.

### Are there Privacy / GDPR considerations?

### Where can I host my podcast files?

Any storage where you have control over the file naming is compatible with Podlove Podcast Publisher. You can manage files using a simple FTP/sFTP or use services like Amazon S3.

### Where can I ask questions and get support?

### How can I help the project?

The continued success of Open Source project relies on the community. There are many ways you can help:
Episode title in API now follows the same rules as in RSS feed. There's a new field 'title_clean' for accessing the specifically set plain episode title, but that might be null in some cases, so it's better to default the 'title' attribute to the usual rules.

All-New Auphonic Module

As you may know we're in the middle of upgrading all the sections in the episode
screen. One of the more involved projects was(!) the Auphonic module. Feature
requests for Multitrack support appeared since the feature was introduced by
Auphonic, but the thought of adapting the module always felt daunting.

Now we took the chance to rethink the workflow from the ground up, hopefully
making everything a little easier; and of course there's multitrack support now.

I just checked, Auphonic released their Multitrack feature in 2014
(https://auphonic.com/blog/2014/10/21/auphonic-multitrack-algorithms-release/).
So we're lagging a little behind, but we caught up! You can now create
multitrack productions directly from inside Podlove Publisher.

Please give the new interface a try, and send any feedback you have our way.

We're working on bringing the whole JavaScript codebase onto a modern foundation. You will discover the Chapter Marks and Transcripts sections have a new look, as they are the first components we upgraded. They should be functionally equivalent to before.

In the long run, this new foundation will allow us to build better interfaces on top of recent web technology.
