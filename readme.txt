The one and only next generation podcast publishing system. Seriously. It's magical and sparkles a lot.

== Description ==

We built the Podlove Podcast Publisher because existing solutions are stuck in the past, complex and unwieldy. The Publisher helps you save time, worry less and provides a cutting edge listening experience for your audience.

Official Site: [publisher.podlove.org](http://publisher.podlove.org/)

= Video Tutorial: Getting started with Podlove Publisher =

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmrm-jUe6u4]

= Compatible Feeds =

The Publisher makes it easy to create highly expressive, efficient and super compatible podcast feeds with fine grained control over client behavior (e.g. GUID control to replace faulty episodes and for clients to reload) supporting all important meta data.

= Multi-Format Publishing =

The Publisher also makes multi-format publishing - embracing all modern and legacy audio and video codecs - a snap. By adopting simple file name conventions, the plugin allows the podcaster to provide individual feeds for certain use cases or audiences without adding work for the podcaster during the publishing process.

= Optimized Web Player =

The Publisher also comes with integrated with the Podlove Web Player plugin (which you do not need to install separately) and fully support its advanced options including multiple audio (MP4 AAC, MP3, Vorbis, Opus) and video (MP4 H.264, WebM, Theora) format support for web browsers. This Web Player is fully HTML5 compatible (but provides Flash fallback for ancient environments) and is ready for all touch based clients too.

= Chapter Support =

The Publisher also makes it easy to publish chapter information in the player to make access to structured episodes even easier. Full support for linking directly to any part of your podcast on the web with instant playback included.

= Flexible Templates =

To round it all up, a flexible template system enables you to published Podcasts in a defined fashion and change the style at any time without having to touch your individual postings later on.

And this is just the beginning. We have a rich roadmap that will bring even more interesting features: integration with helpful services, much improved timeline metadata support (show notes) and much more.

== Changelog ==

= 2022-01-28 =

- episode: after file revalidation, auto-detect duration
- contributors: assign a `Sponsor` role and it will appear as `<podcast:person ... role="sponsor">...` in the RSS feed

= 2022-01-21 =

- New module: Automatic Numbering. Automatically increase the Episode number when creating episodes. When using the "Shows" module, each show has its own numbering.

= 3.7.0 =

**Shownotes**

The Shownotes module helps you manage link based show notes to display on your website and podcatchers.

The module UI has been rewritten and streamlined for efficient workflows.
A new UI element was added to allow for quickly sorting long lists of links into topics:
Whenever a link is dragged, a floating list of all topics appears next to the cursor.
The link can then be dropped under the desired topic there instead of scrolling through the whole list of shownotes.

Disclaimer: URL metadata detection uses a service hosted at [plus.podlove.org](https://plus.podlove.org). It is currently available for all users of Podlove Publisher. In the future, metadata detection may only be availabe to Publisher PLUS users as it requires infrastructure to run. The rest of the Shownotes functionality will stay available to all Podlove users as usual.

Documentation: https://docs.podlove.org/podlove-publisher/modules/shownotes

**Contributors**

* Notifications: add "always send to..." section. Contributors selected there will always receive update notifications.
* Avatars: default avatar is now a static svg instead of Gravatar (can be customized using the WordPress Filter `podlove_default_contributor_avatar_url`)

**Enhancements for creating Auphonic productions** (thanks [lumaxis](https://github.com/lumaxis)!):

* when the episode title is set, send this instead of the post title ([#1240](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/pull/1240))
* send the episode number as track number ([#1240](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/pull/1240))
* when the post thumbnail is configured as cover image, use it as direct fallback  ([#1241](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/pull/1241))

**Webhooks**

Define a webhook that gets triggered every time an episode updates.

The webhook is a `POST` request with an `event` parameter and a `payload`.
`event` is the webhook name ("episode_updated"), `payload` is a serialized
JSON object of the current episode.

Configuration:

    # wp-config.php
    define('PODLOVE_WEBHOOKS', [
        'episode_updated' => 'https://example.com/webhook-endpoint'
    ]);

**Other Changes**

* soundbites: add title field ([#1257](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/pull/1257), [#1237](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/issues/1237))
* allow detection of episode duration on mp4 ([#1249](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/pull/1249))
* update OPAWG data (for download analytics / user agent detection)

**Fixes**

* fix: parameters for shortcode `[podlove-episode-contributor-list]` ([#1233](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/issues/1233))
* fix: PHP 8 warnings ([#1258](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/issues/1258))
* fix: deleting an episode deletes its transcript from the database ([#1252](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/issues/1252))
* fix(contributors): notification test email ([#1247](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/issues/1247))
* fix(analytics): filtering of httprange requests with one or two bytes ([#1243](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/issues/1243))
* fix(image cache): redirect to source URL if image can't be downloaded into the cache

= 3.6.1 =

* fix: sql issue when creating the episode database tables

= 3.6.0 =

**New Module: Soundbite**

Adds support for the `<podcast:soundbite>` RSS feed tag.
The intended use includes episodes previews, discoverability, audiogram generation, episode highlights, etc.

Using this module you can specify an audio segment for each episode that can be read by for example audiogram generation services.

**New Module: WordPress File Upload**

If you are using WordPress Media as storage for your Podlove assets, this new
module adds conveniences.

First, you define a `Upload subdirectory` for your Podlove assets. This overrides
any WordPress settings, so for example you can safely enable the typical date/month
structure for WordPress attachments and it will not affect your Podlove Uploads.

Then you can update your "Podlove - Media - Upload Location" setting. You can keep
it empty to let Podlove Publisher take care of it, or set it yourself if you have
a custom file hostname.

Now there is an "Upload Media File" button in your episode form above
the "Episode Media File Slug" where you can directly upload your files.
If you are using multiple assets, you can upload them all there. Just make sure
they all have the same filename (except the file extension) before you upload.

= 3.5.5, 3.5.6 =

**Fixes**

* SECURITY: sql injection in "Social & Donations" module
* transcript API returns list again
* PLUS open graph images (use new API)
* handle webvtt voice, missing Contributors
* related episodes: remove whitespace in shortcode HTML to fix rendering in Spotify

**Changes**

* webvtt transcripts use public contributor name
* transcript voices / contributors:
  * you can now select "none" in the voice assignment
  * only voices with an assigned contributor (and not "none") appear in public transcripts
* generate default copyright claim if it is not explcitly set

= 3.5.4 =

* adds copyright field in "Podcast Settings - Directory", which is apparently required by the Apple Podcast Directory since yesterday.
* perf: remove frontend.js (inline logic to download button HTML)

= 3.5.2 / 3.5.3 =

This releases reverses all changes to Permalinks in releases 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.

I severely underestimated the effect these changes would have and revert all changes until I find a better solution. It’s simply not acceptable to change episode URLs, especially without an option for automatic redirects.

Please verify your episode URLs and the two expert settings “Permalink structure for episodes” and “Episode Pages”.

What to do if you have used the “PODLOVE_ENABLE_PERMALINK_MAGIC” constant? It has no effect any more and you can safely remove it from your config file.

What happened to the “Simple Episode Permalink” setting from release 3.5.1? It has been removed, too.

Sorry for the trouble.
Happy podcasting :)

**Other**

* fix: remove usage of PHP 7.1 syntax in one file

= 3.5.1 =

= 2021-04-14 =

* add: expert setting to make episode permalinks `/%postname%/`
* add: include Publisher Database Version in system report
* drop WordPress version requirement to 4.9.6

= 3.5.0 =

**Breaking Change**

Removes two expert settings:

* "Permalink structure for episodes" and
* "Episode pages"

These settings allowed to define custom URL structures for episodes and the episode archive.
However they have caused trouble for a long time (see [#1038](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/issues/1038))
and the only viable way out seems to remove them.

How does that affect you?

If you have never touched these settings, feel free to shrug, smile and move on.

If you _are_ using these settings, I encourage you to consider not using them as they are mostly of cosmetic nature.
Should you however prefer to keep everything as is (including the known bugs of erratically broken permalinks / URLs), you can
enable the settings back with a single line of code in your wp-config.php:

    `define('PODLOVE_ENABLE_PERMALINK_MAGIC', true);`

**Experimental: Full-Page Podlove Templates**

If you want to create a 100% custom page based on an episode but without all the WordPress theme around, this is for you.
Possible use case: A dedicated page to print the episode transcript.

1. create a new Podlove Template, for example `page-episode-transcipt`
2. Write that transcript as a _full HTML page_. That means it starts with `<!doctype html><html>` and ends with `</html>`!
3. Append `?podlove_template_page=page-episode-transcipt` to your public episode URL. For example if your episode is `https://example.com/ep001/`, then open `https://example.com/ep001/?podlove_template_page=page-episode-transcipt`

Very simple example template:

    <!doctype html>
    <html>

    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <title>Transcript | {{ episode.title }} | {{ podcast.title }}</title>
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    </head>

    <body>

      <p>
        Here's the transcript for podcast <strong>{{ podcast.title }}</strong> episode <strong>{{ episode.title }}</strong>:
      </p>

      [podlove-transcript]

    </body>

    </html>

Enjoy!
