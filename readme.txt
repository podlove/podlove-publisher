The one and only next generation podcast publishing system. Seriously. It's magical and sparkles a lot.

== Description ==

We built the Podlove Podcast Publisher because existing solutions are stuck in the past, complex and unwieldy. The Publisher helps you save time, worry less and provides a cutting edge listening experience for your audience.

Official Site: [publisher.podlove.org](http://publisher.podlove.org/)

= Video Tutorial: Getting started with Podlove Publisher =

= Compatible Feeds =

The Publisher makes it easy to create highly expressive, efficient and super compatible podcast feeds with fine grained control over client behavior (e.g. GUID control to replace faulty episodes and for clients to reload) supporting all important meta data.

= Multi-Format Publishing =

The Publisher also makes multi-format publishing - embracing all modern and legacy audio and video codecs - a snap. By adopting simple file name conventions, the plugin allows the podcaster to provide individual feeds for certain use cases or audiences without adding work for the podcaster during the publishing process.

= Optimized Web Player =

The Publisher also comes with integrated with the Podlove Web Player plugin (which you do not need to install separately) and fully support its advanced options including multiple audio (MP4 AAC, MP3, Vorbis, Opus) and video (MP4 H.264, WebM, Theora) format support for web browsers. This Web Player is fully HTML5 compatible (but provides Flash fallback for ancient environments) and is ready for all touch based clients too.

= Chapter Support =

The Publisher also makes it easy to publish chapter information in the player to make access to structured episodes even easier. Full support for linking directly to any part of your podcast on the web with instant playback included.

= Flexible Templates =

To round it all up, a flexible template system enables you to published Podcasts in a defined fashion and change the style at any time without having to touch your individual postings later on.

And this is just the beginning. We have a rich roadmap that will bring even more interesting features: integration with helpful services, much improved timeline metadata support (show notes) and much more.

**New Publisher PLUS**

=> [plus.podlove.org](https://plus.podlove.org/)

Publisher PLUS is a new service providing Feed Proxy and Podcast Subscriber statistics for Podlove Publisher.

To use it, enable the *Publisher PLUS* module, then visit [plus.podlove.org](https://plus.podlove.org/) to create an account.

Subscriber Statistics are only the beginning. Expect more features soon!

**Experimental: Shownotes**

Generate and manage episode show notes. Helps you provide rich metadata for URLs. Full support for Publisher Templates.

This module is a work-in-progress. But it's usable, so feel free to give it a try, especially if your shownotes are link-heavy and you're comfortable writing Podlove (Twig) templates.

The module is currently hidden. Make it visible by setting a PHP constant, for example in your `wp-config.php`: `define('PODLOVE_MODULE_SHOWNOTES_VISBLE', true);`.

Use this template as a starting point: https://gist.github.com/eteubert/d6c51c52372dc2da2f1734a5f54c7918
