The one and only next generation podcast publishing system. Seriously. It's magical and sparkles a lot.

== Description ==

We built the Podlove Podcast Publisher because existing solutions are stuck in the past, complex and unwieldy. The Publisher helps you save time, worry less and provides a cutting edge listening experience for your audience.

Official Site: [publisher.podlove.org](http://publisher.podlove.org/)

= Video Tutorial: Getting started with Podlove Publisher =

= Compatible Feeds =

The Publisher makes it easy to create highly expressive, efficient and super compatible podcast feeds with fine grained control over client behavior (e.g. GUID control to replace faulty episodes and for clients to reload) supporting all important meta data.

= Multi-Format Publishing =

The Publisher also makes multi-format publishing - embracing all modern and legacy audio and video codecs - a snap. By adopting simple file name conventions, the plugin allows the podcaster to provide individual feeds for certain use cases or audiences without adding work for the podcaster during the publishing process.

= Optimized Web Player =

The Publisher also comes with integrated with the Podlove Web Player plugin (which you do not need to install separately) and fully support its advanced options including multiple audio (MP4 AAC, MP3, Vorbis, Opus) and video (MP4 H.264, WebM, Theora) format support for web browsers. This Web Player is fully HTML5 compatible (but provides Flash fallback for ancient environments) and is ready for all touch based clients too.

= Chapter Support =

The Publisher also makes it easy to publish chapter information in the player to make access to structured episodes even easier. Full support for linking directly to any part of your podcast on the web with instant playback included.

= Flexible Templates =

To round it all up, a flexible template system enables you to published Podcasts in a defined fashion and change the style at any time without having to touch your individual postings later on.

And this is just the beginning. We have a rich roadmap that will bring even more interesting features: integration with helpful services, much improved timeline metadata support (show notes) and much more.

**IAB Conformity**

When it comes to tracking download intents, Podlove Publisher was always close to IAB recommendations, with one exception: the time window in which two requests count as two. Podlove Publisher deduplicates by hour, IAB recommends a day.

There is a new setting in `Podlove > Expert Settings > Tracking`: "Deduplication Window". It enables you to change the window to "day". This is an opt-in setting, the default will continue to be hourly.

**Transcripts**

“Transcripts” is the new module to manage transcripts, show them on your site and in the web player. You can import them from webvtt files. If you are already using the Podlove Publisher contributors, you can assign people to the voices inside the webvtt. Then you even get avatars automatically in your transcripts.

See [https://forschergeist.de/podcast/fg066-klimaneutralitaet/](https://forschergeist.de/podcast/fg066-klimaneutralitaet/) for an example episode with transcripts in the web player.

**Transcripts: Shortcode**

The shortcode `[podlove-transcript]` displays a pretty html version of the transcript for your website. 

**Transcripts: Twig Template Support**

Of course there is a fully featured template API for transcripts as well. For example:

{% for group in episode.transcript %}
    <div class="ts-group">

        <div class="ts-speaker-avatar">
            {{ group.contributor.image.html({width: 50}) }}
        </div>

        <div class="ts-text">
            <div class="ts-speaker">
                {{ group.contributor.name }}
            </div>

            <div class="ts-content">
                {% for line in group.items %}
                <span class="ts-line">{{ line.content }}</span>
                {% endfor %}
            </div>
        </div>
        
    </div>
{% endfor %}

See [https://docs.podlove.org/podlove-publisher/reference/template-tags.html](https://docs.podlove.org/podlove-publisher/reference/template-tags.html "documentation") for all details.

**Global Podcast Analytics**

The following metrics are now available for the whole podcast:

- downloads per month
- top episodes
- episode asset
- podcast client
- operating system
- download source

**Raw Analytics**

I wouldn’t call this an Analytics API but since it exists to power the analytics screen, I might as well document it. The following endpoints return results in CSV format for easy processing or import to spreadsheets.

Here is an example call that returns the number of downloads in March 2019:

	https://your.domain/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=podlove-analytics-global-downloads-per-month&date_from=2019-03-01T00:00:00.000Z&date_to=2019-03-31T23:59:59.999Z

All requests take the same three parameters:

- `action` defines what data you want
- `date_from` is the start date in ISO 8601
- `date_end` is the end date in ISO 8601

Available actions are:

- podlove-analytics-global-downloads-per-month
- podlove-analytics-global-top-episodes
- podlove-analytics-global-assets
- podlove-analytics-global-clients
- podlove-analytics-global-systems
- podlove-analytics-global-sources

You need to be logged in with admin permissions for the requests to work.

Disclaimer: Depending on the popularity of your podcast and chosen date range, the requests may take a long time to respond, or even fail if the calculation takes longer than the timeout defined in your web server.

**Other**

- background jobs: add button to abort job
- new tab style for chapter marks section
- Podlove Web Player 4 fallback for old browsers and disabled JavaScript
