The one and only next generation podcast publishing system. Seriously. It's magical and sparkles a lot.

== Description ==

We started the Podlove Podcast Publisher project in 2012 because existing solutions were stuck in the past, complex and unwieldy. The Publisher helps you save time, worry less and provides a cutting edge listening experience for your audience.

### Video Tutorial: Getting started with Podlove Publisher

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmrm-jUe6u4]

### Compatible RSS Feeds

The Publisher makes it easy to create highly expressive, efficient and super compatible podcast feeds with fine grained control over client behavior (e.g. GUID control to replace faulty episodes and for clients to reload) supporting all important meta data.

### Multi-Format Publishing

The Publisher also makes multi-format publishing - embracing all modern and legacy audio and video codecs - a snap. By adopting simple file name conventions, the plugin allows the podcaster to provide individual feeds for certain use cases or audiences without adding work for the podcaster during the publishing process.

### Optimized Web Player

The Publisher also comes integrated with the Podlove Web Player plugin and fully supports its advanced options including multiple audio (MP4 AAC, MP3, Vorbis, Opus) and video (MP4 H.264, WebM, Theora) format support for web browsers. This Web Player is fully HTML5 compatible and is ready for all touch based clients too.


### Metadata Galore

* **Chapter Marks:** The Publisher also makes it easy to publish chapter information in the player to make access to structured episodes even easier. Full support for linking directly to any part of your podcast on the web with instant playback included.
* **Contributors:** Bring your team and guests front and center. Manage contributors, including their names, avatars and web urls.
* **Transcripts:** WebVTT transcripts can be imported and even connected to your contributors. They are referenced in the RSS feed so they can be displayed by podcast apps.
* **Seasons:** Does your podcast have seasons? We got you covered with a dedicated "Seasons" module.
* **Related Episodes:** Manage and display related episodes on your website.

### Auphonic Integration

Auphonic is your all-in-one audio post production webtool to achieve a professional quality result. We provide a first class integration module for ease of use and best automation experience.

### Flexible Templates

To round it all up, a flexible template system enables you to published Podcasts in a defined fashion and change the style at any time without having to touch your individual postings later on.

And this is just the beginning. We have a rich roadmap that will bring even more interesting features: integration with helpful services, much improved timeline metadata support (show notes) and much more.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### Is Podlove Podcast Publisher free?

Yes! The core features of Podlove Podcast Publisher are and always will be free.

### Are there Download Statistics?

Yes! Podcast Downloads can be tracked and analyzed. You can easily see how many people downloaded you podcast episodes, which clients they used, if they prefer to subscribe to the feed or listen on your website using the web player—and much more.

### Are there Privacy / GDPR considerations?

Podlove Publisher is GDPR compliant and provides prewritten text snippets for your privacy page. See https://docs.podlove.org/podlove-publisher/guides/dsgvo-gdpr.html

### Where can I host my podcast files?

Any storage where you have control over the file naming is compatible with Podlove Podcast Publisher. You can manage files using a simple FTP/sFTP or use services like Amazon S3.

### Where can I ask questions and get support?

Free support where questions are answered by the community is available in the [Podlove Community Forum](http://community.podlove.org/). There is a German community in the [Sendegate](https://sendegate.de/).

### How can I help the project?

The continued success of Open Source project relies on the community. There are many ways you can help:
Episode title in API now follows the same rules as in RSS feed. There's a new field 'title_clean' for accessing the specifically set plain episode title, but that might be null in some cases, so it's better to default the 'title' attribute to the usual rules.

**Feature: Better control over transcripts in RSS feed**

There is a new feature under `Podlove > Podcast Feeds` called "Episode
Transcripts" to control how episode transcripts should be referenced in your RSS
feed. The default is "Publisher Generated vtt", which is nearly the same
behavior as before (In previous versions, three variants were referenced: vtt,
json and srt. The json and srt URLs still work but they are not referenced in
the RSS feed any more as they are not neccessary and removing them reduces feed
size). There is a dedicated "Do not include in feed" option, in case you do not
want the transcripts in your RSS feed.

Finally, you may prefer to host your transcript assets externally, just like
your audio files. If you have configured a transcript asset, you can now select
it in this setting. Then the RSS feed will reference this external file
directly.

Podlove Publisher 4.0 is here, bringing a spring-clean (in November!) of the episode page. We tore up the foundation to bring you an all-new user interface.

**Warning:** PHP 8.0 and above is now required!

**Highlights**

- **Episode Form** User Interface is modernised and auto-saves, so no work is ever lost.
- **Auphonic module** includes Multitrack Support.
- **New Contributors** can be added without leaving the episode page.
- **Chapters** support images.
- **REST API V2** is now, including many more endpoints. See the [API documentation](https://docs.podlove.org/podlove-publisher/api) for all the details.


**Tidbits**

- file “slug” field is prefixed with the media location so it’s more obvious what it is used for
- episode duration is always auto-detected and not an input field any more
- Auphonic Preset can be selected directly in the episode and does not rely on global module setting any more
- removed module “Twitter Card Integration” (RIP). By the way, if you want to follow us on social media, find us here: https://fosstodon.org/@podlove
- fix various PHP notices and warnings to be PHP 8.0+ compatible
