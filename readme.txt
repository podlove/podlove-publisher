The one and only next generation podcast publishing system. Seriously. It's magical and sparkles a lot.

== Description ==

The Podlove Podcast Publisher is a workflow-oriented solution for serious podcasters that want to save time and get full control over their Podcast publishing process, their feeds and the integrity of their publication.

The Publisher makes it easy to create highly expressive, efficient and super compatible podcast feeds with fine grained control over client behavior (e.g. GUID control to replace faulty episodes and for clients to reload) supporting all important meta data.

The Publisher also makes multi-format publishing - embracing all modern and legacy audio and video codecs - a snap. By adopting simple file name conventions, the plugin allows the podcaster to provide individual feeds for certain use cases or audiences without adding work for the podcaster during the publishing process.

The Publisher also comes with integrated with the Podlove  Web Player plugin (which you do not need to install separately) and fully support its advanced options including multiple audio (MP4 AAC, MP3, Vorbis, Opus) and video (MP4 H.264, WebM, Theora) format support for web browsers. This Web Player is fully HTML5 compatible (but provides Flash fallback for ancient environments) and is ready for all touch based clients too.

The Publisher also makes it easy to publish chapter information in the player to make access to structured episodes even easier. Full support for linking directly to any part of your podcast on the web with instant playback included.

To round it all up, a flexible template system enables you to published Podcasts in a defined fashion and change the style at any time without having to touch your individual postings later on.

And this is just the beginning. We have a rich roadmap that will bring even more interesting features: integration with helpful services, much improved timeline metadata support (show notes) and much more.

Development of the plugin is an open process. The current version is available on github:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### Why do my episodes look the same as my normal posts/missing some information?

The Podlove Podcast Publisher (PPP) uses "custom posts" for its episodes. Some themes treat normal posts and custom posts differently or just forgot to take into account that custom posts show up slightly different in the HTML.

Get in contact with the theme developer and ask if it is ready for custom posts. It is usually not very complicated to make a theme work with custom posts out of the box. PPP does work together will all templates that come with WordPress.

### My episodes do not show up on the home page. What's wrong?

Episodes are kep separate from blog posts but you can choose if you want episodes to be mixed with blog posts on the home page. To do this, check the "Display episodes on front page together with blog posts" setting in the Expert Settings panel.

### Episodes do not show up with the configured permalink URL. What's wrong?

Episodes are custom posts and are dealt with differently by WordPress. They show up under a common URL prefix. You can define the result URL with the "URL segment prefix for podcast episode posts" setting in the Expert Settings panel. This is set to "episode" by default resulting in an episode to show up under "/episode/<episode-slug>".

### Where do I put the URL of my media files?

You don't. The plugin assembles the media file URL by combining various components that you have configured in the Podlove settings. All media files have to reside under a base URL that you specify in the "Podcast Settings" pane. This basically defines which directory all files have to be uploaded to.

The exact media file name is made up of a) the Episode Media File Flug you set in the episode's meta data b) the suffix of the episode asset (as configured in the "Episode Asset" settings page) and c) the extension of the file type of the Episode Asset (as configured in the "File Types" settings page).

### Where is the Web Player / Download list?

Right now, these have to be inserted manually via so called shortcodes. They are [podlove-web-player] and [podlove-episode-downloads].

There are compatibility issues with the "Jetpack" plugin. If you use it, you might need to turn it off.

You can use the plugin's templates to make sure you have the proper shortcodes in every episode.

### A feed link directs me to a blog page. What's wrong?

This is an issue that sometimes arises out of the weirdness that is WordPress. Your settings might be totally okay but there  is some kind of amnesia going on in the WordPress core.

In order to free WordPress from its amnesia go to Settings > Permalinks, hit Save and try again.

### How do I add Flattr integration to my episodes?

If you haven't already, get the official Flattr plugin here:

   http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/flattr/

Find the setting Flattr > Advanced Settings > Flattrable content > Post Types and check "podcast". Save changes. There is no step 3 ;)

**Download Analytics**

You want to know more about who listens to your podcast? We got you covered.

We spent months of research and prototyping to find a reliable way of tracking. We are confident that our approach works and produces trustworthy data. If you have not done so yet, you have to activate tracking in _Expert Settings -> Tracking_.

If you are interested in all the technical details, head over to http://docs.podlove.org/guides/download-analytics/.

But what you are seeing now is just the beginning. We have a plethora of ideas on how to give you even more insight into the data available. Stay tuned!

= 1.10.18 =

**Improvements to media file slugs**

* Media file validation is more consistent: when you get a green checkmark, the file is guaranteed to be valid and reachable.

**Other**

* Once we release Publisher 2.0, we will increase the minimum PHP version to 5.4 and recommend 5.5. A notice is now displayed in the system report if you are running a version requiring an upgrade.

= 1.10.15 =

**Various Fixes and Enhancements**

* Auphonic UI improvement: When selecting a production, the "Select existing production" option disappears.
* Don't pass `redirect=no` parameter to feed URLs
* Ensure web player IDs are unique to avoid rendering bugs
* Fix caching bug that lead to disappearing web player and download buttons
* Fix redirection UI bug
* Flush rewrite rules after migrations to avoid broken links

= 1.10.14 =

**Performance**

A simple yet effective caching strategy has been implemented. This is used to cache rendered site segments. A complete cache invalidation happens when podcast related data changes. This should be a good start since such data rarely changes (mostly when a new episode is published). In a Multisite setup, each site handles its cache separately.

This is implemented using the [Transients API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API). By default, WordPress uses the database as a caching backend. If you want to squeeze out even more speed, consider installing a [Persistent Cache Plugin](http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Object_Cache#Persistent_Cache_Plugins) which replaces the database with a more efficient caching backend, such as memcached or APC. That might require some fiddling around, though.

Caching can be deactivated in the `wp-config.php` with the following line: `define('PODLOVE_TEMPLATE_CACHE', false);`

* Cache Publisher templates
* Cache feed discovery header
* Cache Bitlove widget
* Other minor performance improvements

**Templates**

* There is now a default template containing the player and download section
* Episode contributions can be sorted by comment and position, for example: `episode.contributors({orderby: "comment", order: "DESC"})` or episode.contributors({orderby: "position", order: "ASC"})
* Iterate over the list of episode tags: `{% for tag in episode.tags({order: "DESC", orderby: "count"}) %} {{ tag.name }} {% endfor %}`

**Other**

* Display available processing time in Auphonic production box
* Episode slugs may contain a wider variety of characters now, such as umlauts.
* Feeds now only contain contributors with an URI. Also, output of contributors in feeds can be filtered by group and/or role.
* New donation option for Auphonic Credits
* Remove scary debug output on failed media file validations. This can be found in the log now.
* Fix Auphonic authentication issue by providing the whole certificate chain
* Fix contributor related feed rendering issue

= 1.10.13 =

We decided to remove the "Force Download" feature. Its purpose was to guarantee that a click on a download button results in a download dialogue, rather than playing the media file in the browser. The way we implemented it worked, but came with many downsides. Just to name two of them:
1) We doubled the traffic and significantly increased load since we had to pull all the bytes through the webserver in addition to the download server (even if both are the same).
2) It was impossible to support HTTP range requests. That means no client was able to resume a broken or paused download. It also seemed to lead to strange behaviour in the web player.

But there is another, superior way to force downloads: configure your download server. The important setting here is [Content-Disposition](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec19.html#sec19.5.1).

In *Apache*, you need the `headers` module (`a2enmod headers` on Debian-ish distributions). Then you can add this to your configuration:

	<FilesMatch "\.(mp3|m4a|ogg|oga|ogv|opus|mpg|m4v|webm|flac|pdf|epub|zip)$">
		Header set Content-Disposition attachment
	</FilesMatch>

*lighttpd*:

	$HTTP["url"] =~ "\.(mp3|m4a|ogg|oga|ogv|opus|mpg|m4v|webm|flac|pdf|epub|zip)$" {
		setenv.add-response-header = ("Content-Disposition" => "attachment")
	}

*Nginx*:

	if ($request_filename ~ "\.(mp3|m4a|ogg|oga|ogv|opus|mpg|m4v|webm|flac|pdf|epub)$"){
	    add_header Content-Disposition 'attachment';
	}

**Other Changes**

* Trim whitespace around some URLs that appear in the podcast feed.
* Update certificate for auth.podlove.org
* Fix an issue with saving contributors in `Podlove > Podcast Settings > Contributors`

= 1.10.12 =

**Tracking**

* Never redirect media file URLs to trailing-slash-URLs (WordPress has a habit of adding a trailing slash to every URL via redirect. That is undesirable here, since it create two download intents).
* Handle empty user agent strings
* Do not write anything to tracking-database unless tracking is in analytics mode.

**Other**

* Compress export files via gzip.
* Add tracking data to export files.

= 1.10.11 =

**Tracking**

* For increased compatibility (we are looking at you, iTunes), new file URLs without parameters are used when analytics are active.
* Add `&ptm_file=<episode-slug>.<file-extension>` parameter to the end of Parameter-URLs, so tools like wget generate a filename with a correct extension by default.
* Feed URLs now support a `&tracking=no` parameter, which dynamically disables tracking parameters in feed enclosures. This is introduced for debugging purposes and is only mentioned here for the sake of completeness.
* Fix PHP glitch that caused tracking to go into "Tracking URL Parameters" mode even when it was disabled

**ADN Module**

* Fix issue that could lead to repostings
* Fix tags description
* Messages longer than 256 characters will be shortened now and "…" will be appended

**Other**

* Fix: reenable "force download" option

= 1.10.10 =

We discovered incompatibilities between our tracking implementation and some clients. To avoid further trouble, we are *deactivating tracking* until we solve the issue. The option is still available, we just switch it off automatically with this release and it isn't on by default any more.

If you're of the curious type, feel free to activate it and tell us any issues you run into. Thanks!

= 1.10.9 =

* Fix: When tracking was active but no geo-location database available, downloads would fail. This exception is handled correctly now. You can check the status of tracking and the geo-location database in `Expert Settings > Tracking`

= 1.10.8 =

* Feature: Services in templates can be filtered by their type. That way, you can, for example, iterate over all Twitter accounts via `podcast.services({type: "twitter"})`. The previous "type" parameter (for choosing between "social", "donation" and "all") has been renamed to "category". All default templates have been adjusted accordingly _but if you were using this API in a custom template, you need to change it_.
* Feature: `podcast.contributors` in templates are sorted by name now. You can change the order by writing `podcast.contributors({order: "DESC"})`. When using grouping, each group will be sorted separately.
* Feature: `podcast.contributors({scope: "global-active"})` is limited to contributors with at least one contribution in a published episode. To list contributors ignoring this limitation, use `podcast.contributors({scope: "global"})`. "global-active" is the new default.
* Feature: Allow manual posting of ADN announcements
* Feature: Add contributor support to ADN announcements
* Feature: We are beginning to implement download intent tracking and statistics. As a first step, we are now tracking download intents. A following release will contain an analytics section where you can examine the statistics.
* Feature: The feed `<link>` can be configured in `Expert Settings > Website` now. It still defaults to the home page. Other options include the episode archive and any WordPress page.
* Enhancement: remove encryption for "protected feed" password to prevent autofill browser features to destroy contents
* Enhancement: default WordPress search now covers episode subtitle, summary and chapters
* Enhancement: add Vimeo, Gittip and about.me to services

So if you set it, episodes will additionally appear in `/feed`. However, only in the form of a post. You will not find enclosures, iTunes metadata etc. in `/feed` items.
* Enhancement: sort chapters imported from Auphonic by time
* Enhancement: Changes to feed list: redirect URL is shown and added screen options to hide columns
* Enhancement: Added Publisher version as an attribute to the export file. If a file is imported with a version different from the current Publisher, a warning is displayed.
* Fix: enable group and role selection in contributor shortcodes
* Fix: failing delayed ADN broadcast
* Fix: stop sending ADN announcements for old episodes
* Fix: refresh of Auphonic presets keeps current preset
* Fix: `contributor.episodes` does not return duplicate episodes any more
* Fix: Jabber URL scheme is now prefixed with `jabber:`

= 1.10.6 =

* Fix: contributor services will be saved correctly
* Enhancement: add a donation column to contributor management table

= 1.10.5 =

**Changes to the Templating System**

`episode.recordingDate` and `episode.publicationDate` are DateTime objects now. Available accessors are: year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds. For custom formatting, use `episode.recordingDate.format("Y-m-d H:i:s")` for example. Calling `episode.recordingDate` directly is still supported and defaults to the format configured in WordPress.

**Other Changes**

* Enhancement: Add refresh buttons for ADN patter and broadcast channel selectors
* Fix: Avoid "Grey Goo" scenario of self-replicating contributors

= 1.10.4 =

**Changes to the Templating System**

* New filter: `padLeft(padCharacter, padLength)` can be used to append a character to the left of the given string until a certain length is reached. Example: `{{ "4"|padLeft("0",2) }}` returns "04";
* For consistency `{{ contributor.avatar }}` is now an object. To render an HTML image tag, use `{% include '@contributors/avatar.twig' with {'avatar': contributor.avatar} only %}`.
* `{{ episode.duration }}` has been turned into an object to enable custom time renderings. The duration object has the following accessors: hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds and totalMilliseconds.

__DEPRECATIONS/WARNINGS__

* `{{ episode.duration }}` should not be used any more. The default templates are updated but if you have used it in a custom template, you must replace it. Example: `{{ episode.duration.hours }}:{{ episode.duration.minutes|padLeft("0",2) }}:{{ episode.duration.seconds|padLeft("0",2) }}`
* `{{ episode.license.html }}` and `{{ podcast.license.html }}` are deprecated. Use `{% include '@core/license.twig' %}` for the previous behaviour of choosing the correct license based on context. If you want to be more specific, use `{% include '@core/license.twig' with {'license': episode.license} %}` or `{% include '@core/license.twig' with {'license': podcast.license} %}`.

**Other Changes**

* Feature: ADN Module supports broadcasts
* Enhancement: Contributor shortcode defaults to `donations="yes"` to avoid confusion
* Enhancement: `[podlove-episode-downloads]` now uses templates internally

**All-new, mighty Templating system**

You can now use the [Twig Template Syntax](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/documentation) in all templates. Access all podcast/episode data via the new template API. Please read the [Template Guide](http://docs.podlove.org/tut/understanding-templates.html) to get started.

If you have used templates before, please note that some shortcodes are now _DEPRECATED_. That means they still work but will be removed at some point. Following is a list of affected shortcodes and their replacements:

Instead of `[podlove-web-player]`, write `{{ episode.player }}`.

Instead of `[podlove-podcast-license]`, write `{{ podcast.license.html }}`.

Instead of `[podlove-episode-license]`, write `{{ episode.license.html }}`.

Instead of `[podlove-episode field="subtitle"]`, write `{{ episode.subtitle }}`. Instead of `[podlove-episode field="summary"]`, write `{{ episode.summary }}` etc. When in doubt, look at the [Episode Template Reference](http://docs.podlove.org/ref/template-tags.html#episode).

Changing the podcast data shortcodes works exactly the same: Instead of `[podlove-podcast field="title"]`, write `{{ podcast.title }}` etc. When in doubt, look at the [Podcast Template Reference](http://docs.podlove.org/ref/template-tags.html#podcast).

**Other Changes**

* Feature: The Podlove dashboard includes a section for feeds if you activate the "Feed Validation" module. It is intended as an overview for the state of your feeds.

Additionally, you can validate your feeds against the w3c feed validator right from the dashboard.

**New Module: Contributors**

Podcasts are not possible without their active communities. Huge contributions are being made behind the scenes and nobody notices except the podcaster. The contributors module shines light on all those diligent people. It's now easy to manage contributors of an episode and list them on the blog. The list contains references to their social profiles and the donation service Flattr. Shortcode to display them in an episode post: [`[podlove-contributor-list]`](http://docs.podlove.org/ref/template-tags.html#contributors).

**Simple Protected Feeds**

You can now protect some or all of your feeds using HTTP authentication. Authenticate via a defined username and password or use the WordPress user database as backend.

**License Selector**

We built an interface to generate a Creative Commons license for your podcast and episodes. You can still use a custom URL and name if you don't want a CC license. Use `[podlove-podcast-license]` and `[podlove-episode-license]` to display them in your episode posts.

the system except the episode assistant. And this doesn't do a lot that
can't be done without it either. So we decided to drop both for now.

A similar concept might return once we tackle stuff like seasons.
